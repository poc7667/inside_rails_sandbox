OWNING RAILS STUDENT KIT
========================

Hey, glad to see you here :) Thanks for taking my Owning Rails Masterclass!

Here's everything you need to take the class.

This kit contains:

    cheatsheets.pdf          Your cheatsheets, for quick reference.
    slides/*.pdf             All the slides used in the course.

After the class, I'll send you all the code used in this class, the video recordings and your incredibly awesome super amazing bonus.


LICENSE
-------
One ticket grants access to the class room to ONE person. You can not share the slides, the cheatsheets or the video recordings of the class with anyone. BUT, you can share, reuse, abuse, fork all the code from this class, which will be available on public GitHub repositories.


See you soon. I hope you'll enjoy the course!
